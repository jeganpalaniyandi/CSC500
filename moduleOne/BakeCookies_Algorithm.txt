Flowchart: Video shared by Dr.Holbert in this discussion module.

Assumptions:

- I have to feed many hungry friends(count of ten) that demands producing several batches of cookies; This implies or demands the capacity of baking oven is short for total friends(Let it be only 5 cookies per batch and looping is mandatory).
- Supplies/ingredients are always present and available before execution of processes. 
- A process will start only all the ingredients are supplied.
- Each batch is always made with a predefined quantity of ingredients(finite) and each operation is going to run for pre-defined timings(finite).
- This is going to be end-to-end algorithm for a automated cookie maker with a minimal amount of inputs/ingredients from the user. 
- The cookie maker has the folliwing inbuilt modules
	- Oven module
        - Small mixing bowl module
        - Beater module
        - Parchment arrangment module
        - Cooling rack module

Algorithm:

1. Pre Heat oven to 375°F. Make sure the oven is heating as expected and has progressed atleast to 150°F in 3 minutes. Don't continute to next steps if there is a malfunction with oven(failure handling).  

2. Add ingredients to mixing bowl module to mix flour, baking soda and salt; STOP/PAUSE this module and proceed with step 3. Don't continute to next steps if there is a malfunction with the mixer(failure handling)  

3. Start the Beater module to soften butter and sugars with inbuilt electric mixer on medium speed until fluffy. Handle the beater malfunction. 

4. Transfer the fluffy mixture from step 3 to Stir in flour mixture along with chocolate chips and nuts for 3 minutes.

5. Parchment arrangement module to drop rounded dough with 2 inch perimeter 2 inches apart to parchment-lined cookie sheets. Handle parchment arrangement module failure.

6. Bake for 10 minutes.

8. Transfer the cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool for 30 minutes. Handle cooling rack failure.

9. Repeat the whole process again for the second time so that each friend gets atleast one cookie.

10. Repeat the whole process as needed until the friends hunger is satisfied.

11. If there is any malfunction(error) if with any of the module execution, execute the error block.

12. FINALLY, once all the batches are complete, execute a finally block to clean all the utilized modules.

How to Interpret:

- Followed the general shape representation for a flow diagram. i.e. Diamond is used as decision shape.
- Green arrows going outwards of diamond reprents YES and RED arrows going outwards represents NO.
- The "Process flow" container includes the normal process flow. 
  "Error/ Mal-function block" contains the error processing block. 
  "Finally/Clean block" includes the final action that always be conducted irrespective of the results.
- There is NO catch block included in the Finally block as the flow chart is already complex :)
